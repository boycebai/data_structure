Question:Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
Note:Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
